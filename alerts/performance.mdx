## Overview

Dialect's Alerts Stack is engineered to handle enterprise-scale messaging with exceptional performance. Our infrastructure is designed to support applications with millions of daily active users while maintaining reliability and speed for time-sensitive notifications.

## What Can the Alerts Stack Handle?

Our alerts infrastructure demonstrates proven performance across three core capabilities:

- **Server-Side Alert Sending**: High-throughput APIs for [sending alerts](/alerts/send) from your backend systems to users at massive scale
- **Client-Side Inbox Feeds**: Real-time inbox management and message delivery through our [Universal Inbox](/alerts/integrate-inbox/universal-inbox) for millions of concurrent users  
- **User Subscription Management**: Client-side subscription preferences and notification settings through our [user management system](/alerts/integrate-inbox/user-management) at scale
- **1M+ Daily Active Users**: Handle north of 1 million DAU across all these capabilities

## Time-Sensitive Alerts

Many time-sensitive alerts need to reach users quickly. We have a "burst mode" that can support orders of magnitude higher usage for up to dozens of minutes at a time:

- **Orders of Magnitude Higher Usage**: Scale up dramatically for urgent notifications
- **Extended Duration**: Maintain peak performance for up to dozens of minutes at a time
- **Real-time Processing**: Ensure critical alerts reach users without delay

## Priority Queue

A priority queue handles different kinds of delivery pipelines. For example:

- **High priority alerts** for things like limit orders or liquidation warnings that need fast delivery
- **Lower priority** for broadcast alerts like company announcements, that can be delivered to users over longer timelines

This tiered approach ensures that urgent, actionable alerts are delivered instantly while less time-sensitive communications are processed efficiently over longer timelines.
