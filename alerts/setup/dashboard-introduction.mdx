The **Compose** tab is where you send notifications to your subscribers using a no-code interface.

**How it works:**
1. **Choose a Topic** - Select from your configured topics in the dropdown
2. **Check Subscribers** - See how many users are subscribed to each channel (In App, Telegram, Email)
3. **Create Your Message** - Fill in the title and message content
4. **Add Media (Optional)** - Upload an image for visual impact
5. **Include Call-to-Action (Optional)** - Add a link that acts as a CTA button
6. **Select Channels** - Click on the channel icons (📱 In App, ✈️ Telegram, 📧 Email) to send via multiple channels
7. **Customize per Channel** - Each channel can have different content optimized for its format

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: When sending to multiple channels, you can customize the message for each channel. For example, keep Telegram messages concise while making email content more detailed.
