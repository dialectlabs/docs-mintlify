title: Send Messages
description: Send notifications to your users through various channels using the TypeScript SDK with comprehensive examples for targeted delivery, actionable notifications, and broadcast messaging
---


## Prerequisites

Before sending messages, ensure you have completed these steps:

1. **App Registration**: Register your app with Dialect (see the [registration guide](/alerts/setup/register-app) if you need to set this up)
2. **SDK Setup**: Initialize the Dialect SDK (see our [Setup & Configuration guide](/alerts/send/sdk/setup-configuration) if you haven't done this yet)
3. **User Subscriptions**: Have users subscribed to your app (see our [User Management guide](/alerts/integrate-inbox/user-management) for subscription setup)

## Message Delivery Overview

Dialect's messaging system provides flexible delivery options:

1. **Channel Selection**: Messages are sent according to user channel preferences (IN_APP, email, Telegram)
2. **User Targeting**: Send to individual users, groups, or broadcast to all subscribers
3. **Rich Content**: Support for titles, actions, images, and formatted content
4. **Topic-Based**: Optional targeting based on notification types/topics

## Step 1: Basic Message Sending

### Send to a Single User

Send a notification to a specific user's wallet address. This is the most common messaging pattern.

```typescript
// Basic message to a single user
const recipient = "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM";

const message = {
  title: "Welcome to Our Platform! üéâ",
  message: "Thanks for joining us. Get started by exploring our features.",
  recipient,
};

await dapp.messages.send(message);
```

### Send to Multiple Users

Send the same notification to a specific set of users by providing multiple wallet addresses.

```typescript
// Message to multiple specific users
const recipients = [
  "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM",
  "AnotherWalletAddress123...",
  "YetAnotherWallet456..."
];

const message = {
  title: "System Maintenance Notice",
  message: "We'll be performing scheduled maintenance tonight from 2-4 AM UTC.",
  recipients,
};

await dapp.messages.send(message);
```

### Broadcast to All Users

Send notifications to all users subscribed to your app. When no recipient is specified, Dialect defaults to broadcasting to all subscribers.

```typescript
// Broadcast to all subscribed users
const message = {
  title: "Major Update Released! üöÄ",
  message: "Version 2.0 is now live with exciting new features.",
};

await dapp.messages.send(message);
```

## Step 2: Channel-Specific Delivery

### Target Email and Telegram

Control which channels receive your message by specifying `addressTypes`. Note that IN_APP notifications are always delivered, so you only need to specify additional channels like Email and Telegram.

```typescript
import { AddressType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

// Send via email and Telegram (IN_APP is automatic)
const weeklyUpdate = {
  title: "Weekly Portfolio Summary",
  message: "Here's your portfolio performance for this week...",
  recipient: userWallet,
  addressTypes: [AddressType.Email, AddressType.Telegram]
};

await dapp.messages.send(weeklyUpdate);
```

### Email-Optimized Messages

When sending to email channels, ensure you provide a clear title as it becomes the email subject line.

```typescript
import { AddressType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

// Email-optimized notification
const emailNotification = {
  title: "Transaction Confirmation - Order #12345", // Email subject
  message: `
    Your transaction has been processed successfully.
    
    Order Details:
    - Amount: 0.5 SOL
    - Fee: 0.0025 SOL
    - Transaction ID: 3x7Kj...9mNp
    
    View full details in your dashboard.
  `,
  recipient: userWallet,
  addressTypes: [AddressType.Email]
};

await dapp.messages.send(emailNotification);
```

## Step 3: Interactive & Rich Messages

### Actionable Notifications

Add buttons to your notifications that allow users to take immediate action. Currently supports one action button that can direct users to a website.

```typescript
import { DappMessageActionType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

// Notification with action button
const recipient = "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM";

// Action button configuration
const actionsV2 = {
  type: DappMessageActionType.LINK,
  links: [{ 
    label: "Claim Rewards", 
    url: "https://yourapp.com/claim-rewards" 
  }],
};

const rewardNotification = {
  title: "Staking Rewards Ready! üéØ",
  message: "You've earned 0.15 SOL in staking rewards. Click below to claim them.",
  recipient,
  actionsV2,
};

await dapp.messages.send(rewardNotification);
```

### Rich Content Messages

Include additional context and formatting to make your messages more engaging and informative. Email channels support full HTML formatting, while other channels use plain text.

```typescript
import { DappMessageActionType, AddressType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

const actionsV2 = {
  type: DappMessageActionType.LINK,
  links: [{ 
    label: "View Portfolio", 
    url: "https://yourapp.com/portfolio" 
  }],
};

// Rich HTML content for email channel
const emailMessage = {
  title: "Price Alert: SOL Hit Your Target! üìà",
  message: `
    <h2>üéâ Great news! Solana has reached your target price.</h2>
    
    <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>üìä Current Price:</strong></td>
        <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$145.50</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>üéØ Your Target:</strong></td>
        <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$140.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>üìà Gain:</strong></td>
        <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; color: green;">+3.9%</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p><em>Consider reviewing your position and taking action.</em></p>
  `,
  recipient: userWallet,
  addressTypes: [AddressType.Email], // HTML only works for email
  actionsV2
};

// Plain text version for IN_APP and Telegram
const plainTextMessage = {
  title: "Price Alert: SOL Hit Your Target! üìà",
  message: `
    Great news! Solana has reached your target price.
    
    üìä Current Price: $145.50
    üéØ Your Target: $140.00
    üìà Gain: +3.9%
    
    Consider reviewing your position and taking action.
  `,
  recipient: userWallet,
  addressTypes: [AddressType.Telegram], // Plain text for non-email channels
  actionsV2
};

// Send both versions
await dapp.messages.send(emailMessage);
await dapp.messages.send(plainTextMessage);
```

## Step 4: Topic-Based Messaging

### Send to Topic Subscribers

If you've configured notification types/topics, you can send targeted messages to users who have subscribed to specific categories.

```typescript
// Send to users subscribed to a specific notification type
const defiAlert = {
  title: "New DeFi Opportunity Available",
  message: "A new high-yield farming pool has been added with 15% APY.",
  notificationTypeId: "defi-alerts", // Your configured topic ID
};

await dapp.messages.send(defiAlert);
```

### Topic-Specific Content

Tailor your message content to match the expectations of users who subscribed to specific topics.

```typescript
import { DappMessageActionType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

const actionsV2 = {
  type: DappMessageActionType.LINK,
  links: [{ 
    label: "Vote Now", 
    url: "https://yourapp.com/governance/proposals/123" 
  }],
};

// Governance topic notification
const governanceUpdate = {
  title: "üó≥Ô∏è New Governance Proposal: Protocol Upgrade",
  message: `
    A new governance proposal is now live for voting:
    
    üìã Proposal: Upgrade to V3 Protocol
    ‚è∞ Voting Period: 7 days remaining
    üìä Current Status: 45% participation
    
    Your vote matters for the future of our protocol.
  `,
  notificationTypeId: "governance-updates",
  actionsV2,
};

await dapp.messages.send(governanceUpdate);
```

## Message Examples by Use Case

### Welcome Message
```typescript
import { DappMessageActionType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

const actionsV2 = {
  type: DappMessageActionType.LINK,
  links: [{ label: "Get Started", url: "https://yourapp.com/onboarding" }],
};

const welcomeMessage = {
  title: "Welcome to [Your App]! üéâ",
  message: "Thanks for subscribing! You'll now receive important updates and alerts.",
  recipient: userWallet,
  actionsV2
};

await dapp.messages.send(welcomeMessage);
```

### Transaction Alert
```typescript
import { AddressType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

const transactionAlert = {
  title: "Transaction Confirmed ‚úÖ",
  message: "Your 0.5 SOL transfer to 3x7Kj...9mNp has been confirmed.",
  recipient: userWallet,
  addressTypes: [AddressType.Email] // Also send email record
};

await dapp.messages.send(transactionAlert);
```

### Security Alert
```typescript
import { DappMessageActionType, AddressType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

const actionsV2 = {
  type: DappMessageActionType.LINK,
  links: [{ label: "Review Security", url: "https://yourapp.com/security" }],
};

const securityAlert = {
  title: "üîí Security Alert: New Login Detected",
  message: "A new login to your account was detected from a new device. If this wasn't you, please secure your account immediately.",
  recipient: userWallet,
  addressTypes: [AddressType.Email], // Ensure they get email notification
  actionsV2
};

await dapp.messages.send(securityAlert);
```

### Price Alert
```typescript
import { DappMessageActionType } from '@dialectlabs/sdk';

const actionsV2 = {
  type: DappMessageActionType.LINK,
  links: [{ label: "View Portfolio", url: "https://yourapp.com/portfolio" }],
};

const priceAlert = {
  title: "üìà Price Alert: SOL +12%",
  message: "Solana is up 12% in the last hour, now trading at $145. Your portfolio value has increased by $340.",
  notificationTypeId: "price-alerts",
  recipient: userWallet,
  actionsV2
};

await dapp.messages.send(priceAlert);
```
