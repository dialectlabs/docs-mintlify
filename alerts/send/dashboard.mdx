**Step 3: Review and Send**
- **Complete each desired channel** by filling out content
- **Preview your content** in each tab
- **Click "Send to All Completed Channels"** to deliver simultaneously

### Channel-Specific Best Practices

**Email Notifications:**
- Subject line should be clear and actionable as it appears as the notification title
- Content can use HTML formatting and should include a clear call-to-action
- Images must be hosted with absolute URLs
- Longer content is acceptable up to 4,096 characters

**In-App Notifications:**
- Title should be short and attention-grabbing
- Content must be concise and under 800 characters
- Images should be high-quality, 1:1 aspect ratio, and under 100KB
- Notifications will display in the notification bell component

**Telegram Notifications:**
- Only plain text formatting is supported (no HTML)
- Use emojis sparingly to add visual appeal
- Include full URLs for any action links
- Keep messages concise even though there's a 4,096 character limit

### Dashboard Limitations

**Current Limitations:**
- ‚ùå **No Scheduled Sending**: All notifications send immediately
- ‚ùå **No Bulk Content**: Each channel must be configured individually  
- ‚ùå **No Templates**: Content must be written fresh each time
- ‚ùå **No A/B Testing**: Single message version per channel

**Workarounds:**
- **For Scheduled Sending**: Use programmatic alerts with your own scheduling
- **For Templates**: Save content in external documents for copy/paste
- **For Bulk Operations**: Use the REST API for automated sending

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
1. **Clear Value Proposition**: Explain why this notification matters
2. **Action-Oriented**: Include clear next steps for users
3. **Brand Consistent**: Maintain your voice and tone
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Consider how content appears on mobile devices

### Timing Strategy
1. **Know Your Audience**: Send when users are most active
2. **Respect Time Zones**: Use scheduling for global audiences
3. **Frequency Limits**: Don't overwhelm users with too many alerts
4. **Event-Driven**: Tie notifications to relevant user actions or milestones

### Channel Selection
1. **EMAIL**: Professional announcements, detailed updates
2. **TELEGRAM**: Quick updates, community engagement
3. **IN_APP**: Cross-app visibility, reaches users in integrated applications
4. **PUSH**: Direct mobile alerts (only if you own the mobile app)

## Integration with Other Methods

Dashboard alerts work seamlessly with other Dialect notification methods:

### Programmatic + Dashboard Hybrid
- Use our [APIs](/alerts/send/api) and [SDK](/alerts/send/sdk) for real-time, event-driven notifications
- Use dashboard alerts for planned communications and announcements
- Both methods share the same recipient base and notification topics

### Consistent User Experience
- Users receive notifications through their preferred channels regardless of sending method
- Unified notification history across all sending approaches

## Next Steps
- **Need more control?** Explore programmatic alerts for custom logic via our [SDK](/alerts/send/sdk) or [API](/alerts/send/api)
- **Want event detection?** Check out our [monitoring section](/alerts/alerts-and-monitoring) for triggered alerts
