### Complete Alert Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Dashboard">
Go to [dashboard.dialect.to](https://dashboard.dialect.to), connect your dApp's wallet, and click "Alerts" then "Send a new alert"
</Step>

<Step title="Select Topic">
- **General Broadcast**: Default topic available for all apps
- **Custom Topics**: Create specific categories (product updates, timely alerts, etc.)
- Users can subscribe to specific topics for better control over notifications
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Recipients">
The dashboard supports multiple recipient options:
- **All Subscribers**: Send to all users subscribed to the selected topic, or all app subscribers if no topic was chosen
- **Specific Recipients**: Enter comma-separated wallet addresses (single address for one person, up to 10,000 addresses per message)
</Step>

<Step title="Select Delivery Channel">
Choose one or multiple delivery channels for your alert:
- **Inbox**: In-app notifications displayed in your integrated notification widget
- **Telegram**: Messages sent directly to users' Telegram accounts
- **Email**: Professional email notifications

<Note>
You can select multiple channels to send the same message across different delivery methods simultaneously. To do so, just click on the channel icon.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Alert Content">
- **Title**: Short, attention-grabbing headline
- **Message**: Main notification content
- **Call-to-Action**: Optional button with custom label and URL
- **Image**: Optional image upload to enhance your message
</Step>

<Step title="Test and Send">
- **Send Test Alert**: Optional - send to specific wallet address to preview
- **Review and Send**: Final review before delivery
- **Confirmation**: Dashboard shows delivery status and timestamp
</Step>

### Dashboard Limitations

**Current Limitations:**
- ❌ **No Scheduled Sending**: All notifications send immediately
- ❌ **No Bulk Content**: Each channel must be configured individually  
- ❌ **No Templates**: Content must be written fresh each time
- ❌ **No A/B Testing**: Single message version per channel

**Workarounds:**
- **For Scheduled Sending**: Use programmatic alerts with your own scheduling
- **For Templates**: Save content in external documents for copy/paste
- **For Bulk Operations**: Use the REST API for automated sending

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
1. **Clear Value Proposition**: Explain why this notification matters
2. **Action-Oriented**: Include clear next steps for users
3. **Brand Consistent**: Maintain your voice and tone
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Consider how content appears on mobile devices

### Timing Strategy
1. **Know Your Audience**: Send when users are most active
2. **Respect Time Zones**: Use scheduling for global audiences
3. **Frequency Limits**: Don't overwhelm users with too many alerts
4. **Event-Driven**: Tie notifications to relevant user actions or milestones

### Channel Selection
1. **EMAIL**: Professional announcements, detailed updates
2. **TELEGRAM**: Quick updates, community engagement
3. **INBOX**: Cross-app visibility, reaches users in integrated applications
