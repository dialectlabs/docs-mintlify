title: "Price Change Events"
description: "Never miss significant price movements again. Get instant notifications when tokens hit your custom thresholds, with smart filtering that cuts through market noise to deliver only the alerts that matter."

## How It Works

Dialect continuously monitors token prices and analyzes percentage changes over sliding time windows. When a token's price change exceeds the configured threshold within a time window, a webhook is triggered with detailed information about the price movement.

### Sliding Window Analysis

Price changes are calculated using a sliding window approach:
- **Window Duration**: Configurable time periods (1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 7d)
- **Threshold**: Percentage change required to trigger an event
- **Direction**: Both upward and downward movements are detected

### Supported Time Windows

| Window | Beta Status | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1h | **Available** | Momentum detection, immediate market shifts |
| 3h | Planned | Short-term trend confirmation |
| 6h | Planned | Intraday trend identification |
| 12h | Future | Half-day trend analysis |
| 24h | Future | Daily price movement tracking |
| 7d | Future | Weekly trend detection |

### Webhook Payload

When a price change event is detected, you'll receive a webhook with this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "token_price_change",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:30:00Z",
  "token": {
    "symbol": "SOL",
    "address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"
  },
  "trigger": {
    "type": "sliding_window_percentage_change",
    "window": {
      "duration": "24h"
    },
    "threshold_percentage": 10.0
  },
  "change": {
    "direction": "up",
    "from": {
      "timestamp": "2025-07-03T14:30:00Z",
      "value": 154.25
    },
    "to": {
      "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:30:00Z",
      "value": 171.85
    },
    "absolute_change": 17.6,
    "percentage_change": 11.42
  }
}
```

#### Field Details

- **direction**: `"up"` for price increases, `"down"` for decreases
- **from**: Price and timestamp at the start of the window
- **to**: Price and timestamp at the end of the window
- **absolute_change**: Raw price difference (to.value - from.value)
- **percentage_change**: Percentage change over the window

## Use Cases

### Mobile Wallet Integration
```javascript
// Example webhook handler
app.post('/webhook/price-events', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  if (event.event === 'token_price_change') {
    // Send push notification to users holding this token
    sendPushNotification({
      title: `${event.token.symbol} ${event.change.direction === 'up' ? 'ðŸ“ˆ' : 'ðŸ“‰'} ${event.change.percentage_change.toFixed(1)}%`,
      body: `${event.token.symbol} moved ${event.change.percentage_change.toFixed(1)}% in the last ${event.trigger.window.duration}`,
      data: {
        tokenAddress: event.token.address,
        priceChange: event.change.percentage_change
      }
    });
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Portfolio Tracker Alerts

- Provide context about the magnitude and timeframe of changes
- Enable users to take action based on price movements

### Trading Platform Integration
- Notify traders about tokens meeting their criteria
- Provide entry points for momentum-based trading strategies
- Support risk management through downside alerts
