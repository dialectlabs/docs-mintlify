## Data sources

### Supported launchpads

New token events support the 40+ launchpads available on [Jupiter Pro](https://jup.ag/pro?tab=launchpads), including:

- pump.fun 
- Letsbonk.fun 
- BAGS
- & 40 more


## Detection Criteria

A variety of criteria must be met for an event to trigger, including familiar community "audit" filters, as well as additional analyses we have developed in-house to set a higher bar. Hundreds of tokens satisfy the audit criteria every day. Our added analysis sets a higher bar to just two to five daily.

### Community Audit Filters

All events must meet the familiar community "audit" filters: 

- **✅ Mint Authority**: Revoked to prevent unlimited token creation.
- **✅ Freeze Authority**: Revoked to prevent account freezing.
- **✅ LP Burned**: Liquidity provider tokens burned for permanent liquidity.
- **✅ Holder Distribution**: Top 10 holders hold less than 20% of the total supply.
- **✅ Social Presence**: At least one verified social media account.

*Note: "Audit" refers to community trading terminology, not formal security audits.*

### Advanced Criteria

We employ an additional set of more advanced, in-house criteria to further filter the number of new token events per day. These include: 

- **✅ Market cap**
- **✅ Liquidity**
- **✅ Price change**
- **✅ Trading volume change**

If you'd like to better understand what criteria we have in place, please reach out.

### Top-Down Tuning

Using the criteria above, we then apply a "top-down" tuning approach to achieve an ideal number of events per day, in this case two to five.
