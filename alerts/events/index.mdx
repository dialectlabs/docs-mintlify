# Overview 

Dialect's Events system provides real-time detection and delivery of blockchain-specific events. These events can be used standalone via webhook delivery, or bundled with Dialect's Alerts Stack as off-the-shelf topics.

Developers of all types can use Events for different purposes: to deliver timely alerts to their users, power other custom wallet app event-based capabilities, or even to power trading tools. No complex monitoring infrastructure required.

## What are Events?

Events are triggered when specific onchain or market conditions are met, such as an interesting price change for a token held in a wallet, or a new token is trending.

When an event is detected, the Events system executes the configured behavior: either a webhook delivery or an Alerts Stack notification.

## Supported Event Types

Dialect supports two event types:

1. Price Change Events (Market-Based and Trade-Based)
2. Trending Token Events

### Price Change Events
Price change events detect significant price movements in tokens through two approaches:
- **Market-Based**: Track price movements over sliding time windows (e.g., "SOL is up 10% in 24h")
- **Trade-Based**: Personalized alerts relative to users' actual trade prices (e.g., "SOL is up 50% since you bought")

To read more about both types of price change events, see [Price Change Events](/alerts/events/price-change).

### Trending Token Events
Trending token events trigger when a newly-launched token graduates from a launchpad and meets strict performance criteria.

To read more about this event type, see [Trending Token Events](/alerts/events/trending-token).

## Detecting Interesting Events

Most interesting events are difficult to detect. Some events like "SOL is over $150" may be easy to detect and can sometimes be useful. But it is much more interesting, and much harder, to detect that a token is undergoing unusual price movement, or that one trending token meets strict performance criteria among the many thousands of others that were launched on the same day.

It is also difficult to build an events system that is real time, capable of detecting optimally interesting events, and is rate limited.

Dialect's Events uses advanced techniques to satisfy all three of these across all of of our Event types. To read more about it, see [Technical Overview](/alerts/events/technical-overview).
