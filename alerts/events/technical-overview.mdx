## Architecture

### Event Detection Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time price feeds and on-chain data monitoring
2. **Event Processing**: Sliding window analysis and threshold detection
3. **Webhook Delivery**: Reliable delivery to your infrastructure 

### Webhook Delivery

When an event is detected, Dialect sends an HTTP POST request to your configured webhook endpoint with a structured JSON payload.
## Webhook Payload Schema

All events follow a consistent schema structure:

```json
{
  "event": "token_price_change",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:30:00Z",
  "token": {
    "symbol": "SOL",
    "address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"
  },
  "trigger": {
    "type": "sliding_window_percentage_change",
    "window": {
      "duration": "24h"
    },
    "threshold_percentage": 10.0
  },
  "change": {
    "direction": "up",
    "from": {
      "timestamp": "2025-07-03T14:30:00Z",
      "value": 154.25
    },
    "to": {
      "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:30:00Z",
      "value": 171.85
    },
    "absolute_change": 17.6,
    "percentage_change": 11.42
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **event**: Event type identifier (e.g., `token_price_change`, `trending_token`)
- **timestamp**: UTC timestamp when the event was generated (ISO 8601)
- **token**: Token information including symbol and unique address
- **trigger**: Configuration that caused the event to fire
- **change**: Detailed information about the detected change

## Event Types

### Price Change Events

**Supported Triggers:**
- `sliding_window_percentage_change`: Percentage change over a time window

**Supported Windows:**
- 1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 7d

### Trending Token Events (soon)

Coming soon: Events for newly launched tokens that meet specific safety and quality criteria, including:
- Market cap thresholds
- Audit criteria (mint authority, LP burned, holder distribution)
