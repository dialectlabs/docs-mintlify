## Architecture

### Event Detection Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time price feeds and on-chain data monitoring
2. **Event Processing**: Sliding window analysis and threshold detection
3. **Webhook Delivery**: Reliable delivery to your infrastructure 

### Webhook Delivery

When an event is detected, Dialect sends an HTTP POST request to your configured webhook endpoint with a structured JSON payload.
## Webhook Payload Schema

All webhooks deliver events as arrays, allowing for batch delivery of multiple events in a single request. You can receive multiple events of the same type or mixed event types in one webhook call:

```json

  ]
}
```

### Common Fields

All events share these common fields:

- **event**: Event type identifier (`token_price_change` or `trending_token`)
- **timestamp**: UTC timestamp when the event was generated (ISO 8601)
- **token**: Token information including symbol and unique address
- **trigger**: Configuration that caused the event to fire

For detailed field descriptions and specifications, see the individual event type pages for [Price Change](/alerts/events/price-change) and [Trending Token](/alerts/events/trending-token).
