# Technical Overview

Dialect's Events system is built on a scalable, real-time architecture designed to monitor thousands of tokens and deliver high-quality event notifications through webhooks.

## Architecture

### Event Detection Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time price feeds and on-chain data monitoring
2. **Event Processing**: Sliding window analysis and threshold detection
3. **Quality Filtering**: Advanced algorithms to reduce noise and increase signal quality
4. **Webhook Delivery**: Reliable delivery to your infrastructure with retry logic

### Webhook Delivery

When an event is detected, Dialect sends an HTTP POST request to your configured webhook endpoint with a structured JSON payload.
## Webhook Payload Schema

All events follow a consistent schema structure:

```json
{
  "event": "token_price_change",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:30:00Z",
  "token": {
    "symbol": "SOL",
    "address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"
  },
  "trigger": {
    "type": "sliding_window_percentage_change",
    "window": {
      "duration": "24h"
    },
    "threshold_percentage": 10.0
  },
  "change": {
    "direction": "up",
    "from": {
      "timestamp": "2025-07-03T14:30:00Z",
      "value": 154.25
    },
    "to": {
      "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:30:00Z",
      "value": 171.85
    },
    "absolute_change": 17.6,
    "percentage_change": 11.42
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **event**: Event type identifier (e.g., `token_price_change`, `trending_token`)
- **timestamp**: UTC timestamp when the event was generated (ISO 8601)
- **token**: Token information including symbol and unique address
- **trigger**: Configuration that caused the event to fire
- **change**: Detailed information about the detected change

## Event Types

### Price Change Events

Events triggered by significant price movements over sliding time windows.

**Supported Triggers:**
- `sliding_window_percentage_change`: Percentage change over a time window

**Supported Windows:**
- 1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 7d

### Trending Token Events

Events for launchpad tokens meeting specific criteria.

**Example Payload:**
```json
{
  "event": "trending_token",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:30:00Z",
  "token": {
    "symbol": "EXAMPLE",
    "address": "TokenAddress123..."
  },
  "trigger": {
    "type": "launchpad_breakout",
    "market_cap_threshold": 1000000,
    "audit_criteria": {
      "mint_authority": "revoked",
      "freeze_authority": "revoked", 
      "lp_burned": true,
      "top_holders_check": true,
      "social_presence": true
    }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "current_market_cap": 1250000,
    "trading_volume_24h": 500000,
    "liquidity": 100000
  }
}
```

## Quality Assurance Features

### Signal Enhancement
- **Debouncing**: Prevents rapid-fire notifications for the same token
- **Rolling Averages**: Smooths out short-term volatility for cleaner signals
- **Priority Conflicts**: Manages overlapping events to prevent spam

### Rate Limiting
- Configurable limits per token and per time window
- Global rate limits to prevent system overload
- Smart prioritization of the most significant events

### Reliability
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed webhook deliveries are queued for investigation
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of delivery success rates

## Integration Requirements

### Webhook Endpoint Requirements

Your webhook endpoint must:
- Accept HTTP POST requests
- Return HTTP 200 status for successful processing
- Process requests within 30 seconds (timeout)
- Handle duplicate events gracefully (implement idempotency)

### Security

- **HTTPS Required**: All webhook endpoints must use HTTPS
- **Signature Verification**: Webhooks include signature headers for verification
- **IP Allowlisting**: Static IP ranges available for firewall configuration

### Error Handling

Dialect will retry failed webhook deliveries:
- Initial retry after 1 second
- Exponential backoff up to 5 minutes
- Maximum 10 retry attempts
- Events are marked as failed after all retries are exhausted

## Testing & Validation

### Historical Backtest Process

Before deploying event detection for any token or configuration, Dialect performs extensive backtesting against historical data to validate event quality and timing.

#### Backtest Analysis Steps

1. **Historical Data Collection**: Gather 30-90 days of price data for target tokens
2. **Event Simulation**: Apply detection algorithms to historical data to identify when events would have triggered
3. **Chart Visualization**: Generate annotated charts showing detected events overlaid on price movements
4. **Quality Assessment**: Analyze whether detected events correspond to meaningful price movements
5. **Threshold Calibration**: Adjust parameters to optimize signal-to-noise ratio

#### Example Backtest Results

```
SOL Price Change Events (5% threshold, 1h window)
Date Range: 2024-12-01 to 2024-12-31
Total Events Detected: 47
Average Daily Events: 1.5
Event Success Rate: 78% (events followed by continued momentum)
False Positive Rate: 22%
```

### Chart Integration

Event detection results are visualized on price charts to validate timing and significance:

- **Event Markers**: Clear indicators showing when events would have triggered
- **Price Context**: Event triggers shown relative to support/resistance levels
- **Volume Correlation**: Trading volume overlays to confirm event significance
- **Outcome Analysis**: Color-coded markers showing whether events led to continued momentum

<Tip>
**Validation Partnership**

During beta onboarding, we work with partners to review backtest results together, ensuring event configurations meet your specific quality requirements before going live.
</Tip>

### Success Metrics

We track multiple metrics to ensure event quality:

- **Precision**: Percentage of events followed by meaningful price action
- **Recall**: Percentage of significant price movements that triggered events  
- **Timeliness**: Average time between actual price movement and event detection
- **User Engagement**: Click-through rates and conversion metrics from partner implementations

## Monitoring and Observability

### Real-time Metrics
- Event detection rates per token/event type
- Webhook delivery success rates and latency
- Quality scores based on subsequent price action
- User engagement metrics from partner applications

### Historical Analysis
- Backtesting results for threshold optimization
- Event outcome tracking and success rates
