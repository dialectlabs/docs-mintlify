# Trending Tokens Events

Trending Tokens Events detect launchpad tokens with staying power - not short-lived pumps, but tokens showing genuine traction and sustainable growth potential. Our system focuses on quality over quantity, targeting 2-3 high-conviction events per day rather than overwhelming users with every new launch.

## How It Works

Dialect monitors tokens from major Solana launchpads (primarily pump.fun and Raydium) and applies rigorous filtering to identify tokens with staying power. Rather than alerting on every pump, our system specifically looks for tokens that demonstrate:

- **Sustainable Growth**: Market cap progression that suggests real adoption, not just speculation
- **Safety Characteristics**: Proper tokenomics with revoked authorities and reasonable holder distribution  
- **Community Signals**: Social presence indicating genuine project development
- **Volume Patterns**: Trading activity that suggests organic interest, not artificial manipulation

The goal is to surface 2-3 exceptional opportunities per day that represent tokens transitioning from "meme" to "legitimate project" rather than short-term pump opportunities.

### Detection Criteria

#### Market Metrics
- **Market Cap Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for sub-graduation, graduation, and post-graduation
- **Trading Volume**: Minimum 24-hour trading volume requirements
- **Price Performance**: Percentage change over time windows
- **Liquidity**: Sufficient liquidity for meaningful trading

#### Safety Filters ("Audit Criteria")
- **Mint Authority**: Revoked to prevent unlimited minting
- **Freeze Authority**: Revoked to prevent account freezing
- **LP Burned**: Liquidity provider tokens burned for permanent liquidity
- **Holder Distribution**: Top 10 holders don't dominate supply
- **Social Presence**: At least one social media account

## Webhook Payload

When a trending token event is detected, you'll receive a webhook with this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "trending_token",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:30:00Z",
  "token": {
    "symbol": "NEWMEME",
    "address": "TokenAddress123...",
    "name": "New Meme Token",
    "launchpad": "pump.fun"
  },
  "trigger": {
    "type": "launchpad_breakout",
    "market_cap_threshold": 1000000,
    "audit_criteria": {
      "mint_authority": "revoked",
      "freeze_authority": "revoked",
      "lp_burned": true,
      "top_holders_check": true,
      "social_presence": true
    }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "current_market_cap": 1250000,
    "trading_volume_24h": 500000,
    "liquidity": 100000,
    "price_change_1h": 15.5,
    "price_change_24h": 85.2,
    "holder_count": 1200
  },
  "social": {
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/newmemetoken",
    "telegram": "https://t.me/newmemetoken",
    "website": "https://newmemetoken.com"
  }
}
```

### Field Details

- **launchpad**: Platform where the token was launched (pump.fun, moonshot, etc.)
- **audit_criteria**: Safety checks that passed
- **metrics**: Current market performance data
- **social**: Verified social media presence

## Configuration

### Market Cap Thresholds

| Threshold | Market Cap | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Sub-graduation | $10K - $100K | Early-stage tokens showing initial traction |
| Graduation | $100K - $1M | Tokens that have "graduated" from launchpad |
| Post-graduation | $1M+ | Established tokens with significant momentum |

### Volume Requirements

- **Minimum 24h Volume**: $50K for sub-graduation, $100K for graduation
- **Volume/Market Cap Ratio**: Minimum 0.1 (10% daily turnover)
- **Volume Trend**: Increasing volume over the last 4 hours

### Safety Score Calculation

Each token receives a safety score based on audit criteria:

```javascript
const safetyScore = {
  mint_authority_revoked: 20,    // Critical
  freeze_authority_revoked: 20,  // Critical  
  lp_burned: 15,                 // High importance
  top_holders_distributed: 15,   // High importance
  social_presence: 10,           // Medium importance
  liquidity_adequate: 10,        // Medium importance
  volume_consistent: 10          // Medium importance
};

// Minimum score: 60/100 to trigger event
```

## Target User Persona

The system is designed for users who want:
- **Hands-off Discovery**: Notifications instead of constant terminal monitoring
- **Higher Signal Quality**: Fewer, better opportunities rather than noise
- **Risk Mitigation**: Safety filters to avoid obvious scams
- **Timely Alerts**: Early enough to participate, not too early to be risky

## MVP Implementation

### Phase 1: Quality-First Approach (Current Beta)
**Primary Launchpad**: pump.fun (largest volume and data quality)
**Market Cap Focus**: $100K - $1M (graduation threshold indicating sustainable interest)
**Daily Target**: 2-3 high-conviction tokens maximum
**Quality Gate**: All safety criteria must pass + manual validation
**Success Criteria**: Tokens maintain or grow market cap 7 days post-alert

### Phase 2: Refined Expansion  
**Additional Source**: Raydium launchpad integration
**Market Cap Range**: $50K - $2M (broader but still quality-focused)
**Daily Target**: 3-5 tokens maximum
**Enhanced Filters**: Community engagement metrics and social sentiment

### Phase 3: Mature Platform
**Multi-Launchpad**: pump.fun, Raydium, moonshot coverage
**Adaptive Thresholds**: Market condition-based threshold adjustment
**Daily Target**: 5-7 tokens maximum (never compromise on quality)
**User Preferences**: Risk tolerance and category preferences

## Quality Assurance

### Top-Down Tuning: The 2-3 Daily Events Strategy

Our approach prioritizes signal quality over volume by working backward from the ideal user experience:

**Target**: 2-3 exceptional tokens per day (not 20-30 mediocre ones)
**Method**: Progressively tightens criteria until we achieve this volume
**Validation**: Each event must represent a meaningful opportunity with staying power

#### Calibration Process:
1. **30-Day Historical Analysis**: Review all pump.fun graduations over 30 days
2. **Retroactive Filtering**: Apply various threshold combinations to historical data  
3. **Success Rate Validation**: Track which tokens maintained/grew market cap over 7+ days
4. **Quality Score Development**: Create composite scores weighting market cap, volume, safety, and social factors
5. **Daily Volume Tuning**: Adjust thresholds until historical analysis yields 2-3 high-quality events per day

### Spam Prevention
- **Cooldown Periods**: Minimum time between alerts from same launchpad
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevent alerts for rebranded/similar tokens
- **Velocity Limits**: Rate limiting based on recent alert frequency
- **Quality Scores**: Prioritize tokens with highest potential

## Use Cases

### Mobile Wallet Integration
```javascript
// Example webhook handler for trending tokens
app.post('/webhook/trending-tokens', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  if (event.event === 'trending_token') {
    // Send targeted push notification
    sendPushNotification({
      title: `ðŸš€ ${event.token.symbol} Breaking Out`,
      body: `${event.token.name} hit $${(event.metrics.current_market_cap / 1000000).toFixed(1)}M market cap on ${event.token.launchpad}`,
      data: {
        tokenAddress: event.token.address,
        marketCap: event.metrics.current_market_cap,
        safetyScore: calculateSafetyScore(event.trigger.audit_criteria)
      },
      actions: [
        { action: 'view', title: 'View Token' },
        { action: 'trade', title: 'Trade Now' }
      ]
    });
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Trading Platform Alerts

## Smart Defaults vs Customization

### MVP: Curated Quality Defaults
Beta users receive alerts based on rigorously tested criteria optimized for quality:
- Market cap: $100K - $1M range (graduation sweet spot)
- All safety criteria must pass (no exceptions for risky tokens)
- Sustained volume: $100K+ over 24h (not just brief spikes)  
- **Maximum 2-3 alerts per day** (quality over quantity)
- Manual validation overlay during beta phase

### Future: User Customization
Power users can customize:
- Market cap ranges and thresholds
- Safety score requirements (risk tolerance)
- Launchpad preferences
- Alert frequency limits
- Token category filters

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- **Click-through Rate**: Percentage of users who tap notifications
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage who view token details or trade
- **Alert Quality Score**: User ratings of alert relevance

### Performance Metrics  
- **Token Success Rate**: Percentage of alerted tokens that maintain/grow market cap
- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of tokens that quickly lose value
- **Discovery Efficiency**: How early alerts come relative to major price moves

## Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Respect User Preferences**: Honor opt-out settings and frequency limits
2. **Provide Context**: Include safety score and risk assessment
3. **Enable Quick Actions**: Direct links to token details and trading
4. **Track Performance**: Monitor which alerts lead to user engagement
