## Detection Approach

### Top-Down Tuning Strategy

We use a "top-down" approach - working backward from an ideal user experience rather than forward from available data:

**Target**: 2-3 exceptional tokens per day (not 20-30 mediocre ones)  
**Method**: Progressively tighten criteria until we achieve this volume  
**Validation**: Each event must represent a meaningful opportunity with staying power

This prevents alert spam while ensuring users don't miss meaningful opportunities that have genuine potential to transition from "meme" to "legitimate project."

### Monitoring Sources

The system monitors tokens from major Solana launchpads, with initial focus on:
- **pump.fun** - Primary source due to volume and data quality
- **Raydium** - Secondary integration planned
- **Other launchpads** - Future expansion based on market activity

## Detection Criteria

### Market Metrics
- **Market Cap Thresholds**: Focus on graduation and post-graduation levels indicating sustainable interest
- **Trading Volume**: Minimum requirements to ensure genuine activity
- **Price Performance**: Sustained movement rather than brief spikes
- **Liquidity**: Sufficient depth for meaningful trading

### Safety Filters ("Audit Criteria")

Standard filters used by the trading community to identify legitimate projects:

- **Mint Authority**: Revoked to prevent unlimited token creation
- **Freeze Authority**: Revoked to prevent account freezing  
- **LP Burned**: Liquidity provider tokens burned for permanent liquidity
- **Holder Distribution**: Top 10 holders don't dominate token supply
- **Social Presence**: At least one verified social media account

*Note: "Audit" refers to community trading terminology, not formal security audits.*

### Additional Quality Signals
- **Community Engagement**: Social media activity and follower growth
- **Volume Patterns**: Organic trading activity vs artificial manipulation
- **Sustainability Indicators**: Market cap progression suggesting real adoption
