title: Integrate with Existing Systems
description: Integrate Dialect's alert sending directly into your existing workflows and event detection systems
---

If you already have event detection in your backend (webhooks, database triggers, custom monitoring, existing alerting systems), you can integrate Dialect's alert sending directly into your existing workflows. This approach leverages your current infrastructure while adding Dialect's multi-channel notification capabilities.

<Info>
**When to Use This Approach**
- ✅ You have existing event detection systems
- ✅ You have custom business logic for notifications  
- ✅ You prefer to control when and how events are detected
- ✅ Your events are primarily off-chain or custom patterns
- ✅ You want to integrate with existing backend services

**Alternative:** If you need event detection, check out [Dialect Monitor](/alerts/alerts-and-monitoring/setup-event-detection) for automated monitoring solutions.

## Integration Overview

The integration process involves two main steps:

1. **Configure Dialect SDK/API** in your backend services
2. **Send notifications** at the point of events in your application
