## What is the Mobile Alert Stack?

The Mobile Alert Stack is a comprehensive suite of open APIs bundled with Firebase push notifications that extends Dialect's current alerts stack with cross-platform, cross-language capabilities. It's designed as parts of our product offering that get you ready for mobile‚Äîenabling Web3 applications to deliver notifications across mobile, web, email, and messaging platforms from a single integration.

Built from the ground up to support the same features as our existing Alert Stack, the Mobile Alert Stack now operates as a set of APIs that can be used cross-platform across React, Swift, Kotlin, React Native, and more to deliver the same experience directly inside your mobile app.


## Key Features

### Cross-Platform API Integration

### Firebase Push Notifications (Bundled)
Native mobile push notifications delivered through Firebase, bundled directly with the Mobile Alert Stack. We handle all the routing under the hood, including what users have subscribed for and what they haven't.

### Multi-Channel Messaging
In-App, Email and Telegram are available as separate offerings, providing users choice in how they receive different types of alerts.

## Why Mobile Push Notifications?

Web3 is increasingly mobile-first, and users expect instant notifications for critical events like liquidation warnings, price alerts, governance proposals, and trading opportunities.

Push notifications offer unique advantages:

- **Instant Delivery**: Push notifications arrive immediately, even when apps aren't open
- **Native Experience**: Seamless integration with device notification systems  
- **Higher Engagement**: Push notifications typically see 3-10x higher open rates than email
- **Privacy-First**: No need to share email addresses or join Telegram channels
- **Rich Content**: Support for images, actions, and custom data

### Cross-Platform Consistency
The same notification system powers all channels, ensuring consistent messaging and user experience whether users receive alerts via push, email, or in-app notifications.

Users can choose their preferred channels for different alert types:

| Alert Type | üì± Push | üìß Email | üí¨ Telegram | üìã In-App |
|------------|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Critical alerts** (liquidations, security) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Trading signals** (price alerts) | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| **Daily summaries** (portfolio updates) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| **Governance proposals** (voting deadlines) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Transaction confirmations** (swaps, sends) | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

This approach ensures your users never miss important information, regardless of their preferred communication method or device.
