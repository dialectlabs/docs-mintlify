The Standard Blinks Library (SBL) is a curated collection of production-ready Blinks from leading Solana ecosystem projects. Instead of building from scratch, discover, test, and integrate proven Blinks that users already know and trust.

## What is the Standard Blinks Library?

SBL is your gateway to the most popular and reliable Blinks in the Solana ecosystem. Each Blink in our library has been tested, verified, and optimized for performance across different platforms and wallets.

- **Raydium**: Decentralized exchange and liquidity provision
- **Drift**: Perpetual trading and derivatives
- **Kamino**: Yield farming and automated strategies  
- **Meteora**: Dynamic liquidity pools
- **Lulo**: Yield optimization
- **Solana**: Native staking and validator operations
- **MarginFi**: Lending and borrowing
