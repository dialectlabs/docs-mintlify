## Choose Life: APIs Over SDKs

In crypto, we live at dog-year speed. Protocols ship fast, integrations need to be faster. But here's the challenge: every SDK you maintain, every programming language you support, creates a long chain of breaking changes.

**Strong APIs are a win-win**

<Info>The best teams are switching to strong APIs instead of maintaining SDKs and the Standard Blinks Library brings this approach to Solana's top protocols.</Info>

### Transactions as a Service

Think of the SBL as **Transactions as a Service**. Instead of:
- Installing heavy SDKs
- Learning protocol-specific APIs
- Managing dependencies across languages
- Dealing with breaking changes

You simply:
- Make an HTTP request
- Receive a ready-to-sign transaction
- Sign it with any wallet

**Every programming language can do this.** Mobile, web, backend. It doesn't matter. If it can make an HTTP request, it can integrate any protocol in the SBL.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Blink">
    Browse the protocol-specific sections in the SBL to find the operation you need (swap, deposit, claim, repay, withdraw, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch the Transaction">
    Make a simple POST request with the user's wallet address. Get back a ready-to-sign transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign and Send">
    Sign the transaction with the user's wallet and send it to Solana. Done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The only difference between protocols is the URL. Everything else stays the same:

```typescript {2,6}
// Define your action - same pattern for any protocol
const swapUsdcToSol = 'https://jupiter.dial.to/api/v0/swap/USDC-SOL/100'
// const borrowSolOnJupiter = 'https://jupiter.dial.to/api/v0/lend/borrow/1/2433/borrow?percentage=90'
// const lendUsdcOnKamino = 'https://kamino.dial.to/api/v0/lend/HDsayqAsDWy3QvANGqh2yNraqcD8Fnjgh73Mhb3WRS5E/deposit?amount=100'

const response = await fetch(swapUsdcToSol, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ account: userWalletAddress })
});

const { transaction } = await response.json();
// That's it. Sign and send.
```
