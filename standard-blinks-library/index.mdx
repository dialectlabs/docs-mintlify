The Standard Blinks Library (SBL) provides production-ready APIs for creating transactions with Solana's most popular protocols. Instead of building integrations from scratch or learning complex protocol SDKs, use our tested endpoints to bring DeFi experiences into your app with simple HTTP requests.


## Supported Protocols

We support major protocols like Jupiter, Kamino, Raydium, Orca, Meteora, and more. For the complete list of available integrations, visit our [Supported Protocols](/markets/supported-protocols) page or browse protocols in the left sidebar menu.

<Tip>
Don't see what you're looking for? New protocols are added regularly—[request an integration](https://form.typeform.com/to/aLMntdWJ) and we'll help you get started.
