The Standard Blinks Library (SBL) provides production-ready APIs for creating transactions with Solana's most popular protocols, including rich metadata for building interfaces around them. Instead of building integrations from scratch or learning complex protocol SDKs, use our tested and optimized endpoints to create reliable blockchain experiences.


## What is the Standard Blinks Library?

The SBL is a collection of APIs that return ready-to-sign transactions for major Solana protocols. Each endpoint follows the [Solana Actions specification](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions) and provides:

## What Protocols are Included in the Standard Blinks Library?

- **Jupiter** - Token swaps
- **Raydium** - CLMM pools, AMM pools, and RAY staking
- **Orca** - Whirlpools (concentrated liquidity)
- **Meteora** - Token launches and DLMM pools
- **Kamino** - Lending and liquidity vaults
- **MarginFi** - Lending protocol
- **Drift** - Strategy vaults
- **Lulo** - Protected and boosted deposits

New protocols and capabilities are added every week. If you're looking for a specific integration, [reach out to us](https://form.typeform.com/to/WlSWtZDY).


## Getting Started

Get up and running in under 5 minutes with zero SDK complexity. Just copy, paste, and customize.

### APIs for Transactions

Fetch ready-to-sign transactions for any supported protocol:

```typescript
// Fetch ready-to-sign transaction for swapping 100 USDC to SOL
const response = await fetch('https://jupiter.dial.to/api/v0/swap/USDC-SOL/100', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    account: userPublicKey // User's wallet address
  })
});
const { transaction } = await response.json();
```

### Out-of-the-Box UI Components

Blockchain links come with a rich set of metadata that can be used to unfurl a set of interfaces and components with virtually zero code:

```typescript
import { Blink } from '@dialectlabs/blinks';

// Render a component for swapping USDC to SOL
<Blink url="https://jupiter.dial.to/api/v0/swap/USDC-SOL" />
```

**Low maintenance, high value**: Each endpoint handles protocol complexity, validation, and optimization so you can focus on your user experience. Ready-to-sign transactions come pre-validated with optimal parameters.
