The Standard Blinks Library (SBL) provides production-ready API endpoints for creating Blinks with Solana's most popular protocols. Instead of building integrations from scratch or learning complex protocol SDKs, use our tested and optimized endpoints to create reliable blockchain experiences.


## What is the Standard Blinks Library?

SBL is a collection of API endpoints that return ready-to-sign transactions for major Solana protocols. Each endpoint follows the [Solana Actions specification](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions) and provides:

- **Ready-to-sign transactions** with validated parameters
- **Optimized metadata** for rich UI experiences  
- **Error handling** with clear user messages
- **Rate limiting** and **monitoring** built-in


## Getting Started

Get a Blink running in under 5 minutes with zero SDK complexity. Just copy, paste, and customize:

```typescript
import { Blink } from '@dialectlabs/blinks';

// Render a Blink component for swapping USDC to SOL
<Blink url="https://jupiter.dial.to/api/v0/swap/USDC-SOL" />
```

Or use our headless integration for full control:

```typescript
// Fetch ready-to-sign transaction for swapping 100 USDC to SOL
const response = await fetch('https://jupiter.dial.to/api/v0/swap/USDC-SOL/100', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    account: userPublicKey // User's wallet address
  })
});
const { transaction } = await response.json();
```

**Low maintenance, high value**: Each endpoint handles protocol complexity, validation, and optimization so you can focus on your user experience. Ready-to-sign transactions come pre-validated with optimal parameters.
