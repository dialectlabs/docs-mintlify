Blockchain Links, aka Blinks, are the fastest way to take onchain experiences and make them distributable and actionable everywhere. This technology lets applications unbundle their product experiences from their apps and sites, allowing users to take instant, no-redirect actions wherever they are.

Any client that has blinks integrated into their application can point to a blockchain link which will automatically unfurl into complete, interactive experiences. Blinks don't just remove the need of SDKs in most cases, but also ensure that the implementation of your service follows your design principles and best practices, reducing the risk of incorrect implementations or poor user experiences.

By building with blinks, you ensure that developers can integrate your service in seconds while you still own the blink. Since you maintain full control of the blink from a single location, any updates you make are automatically reflected wherever your blink is served, eliminating the need for third parties to update their SDKs.

The ecosystem's most innovative teams are already building with Blinks, creating powerful new ways to interact with blockchain technology. This widespread adoption opens up exciting possibilities for both developers and users.

These docs cover the Blinks specification, how Blinks are built, how they unfurl natively in front ends (or via chrome extensions), and provide practical resources on how to get started developing today.
