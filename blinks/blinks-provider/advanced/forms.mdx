Forms allow you to build blinks with multiple inputs and advanced input types. They work similar to `HTML` forms, meaning you define input types, such as dropdowns, radio buttons, text, etc. and decide which input is required.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxjhra4h/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/dialect-docs/action-types-overview.png" alt="Examples of blink forms" />

Once the users have finished their inputs, they click on the submit button to send the data to your blinks provider.

Best part: Our blink components even check if the inputs were correct before sending them to your backend, so that you don't have to implement these checks again.

The following examples will show code examples for building forms. We will focus only on the `GET` part. They won't show how `POST` requests look like, because the `POST` interactions work the same way any other blink would. If yo want to see the `POST` part, it is recommended to go to our donation blink example.

<Info>
Forms usually have multiple input fields. This means that you have to work with `linked actions` meaning you set your input params in the links object (see code example below).

## Transfer blink example

This example contains the code for the `GET` request of a SOL transfer blink. As you can see, the blink has two input fields.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dnxjhra4h/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/dialect-docs/transfer-blink-input.png" alt="Transfer SOL blink input fields" />

The first is a text input for the wallet address and the required tag ensures that no empty textfield can be submitted. Second input is a number ensuring that the SOL amount that should be transferred is a number.

```typescript
// GET request for SOL transfer blink

export const GET = async (req: Request) => {
  const response: ActionGetResponse = {
    type: "action",
    icon: `${new URL("/transfer-sol.png", req.url).toString()}`,
    label: "Send SOL",

      "This Blink demonstrates how to send SOL on the Solana blockchain. It is a part of the official Blink Starter Guides by Dialect Labs.  \n\nLearn how to build this Blink: https://dialect.to/docs/guides/transfer-sol",
    // If you have multiple inputs
    links: {
      actions: [
        {
          type: "transaction", // Defines this as a blockchain transaction
          label: "Send SOL",
          // This is the endpoint for the POST request
          href: "/api/transfer-sol?receiver={receiver}&amount={amount}",
          // Required user inputs
          parameters: [
            {
              type: "text",
              label: "Recipient Public Key",
              name: "receiver",
              required: true, // Sets input as required
            },
            {
              type: "number", // Input is number, checks this in frontend
              label: "Amount",
              name: "amount",
              required: true, // Sets input as required
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  };

  // Return the response with proper headers
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(response), {
    status: 200,
    headers,
  });
};
```

## Advanced input types

The example above shows a very basic blink that transfers SOL to another Solana address. As already discussed in this section, there are more input types than text and numbers, which we refer to as advanced input types.

The following advanced input types are available:

- `text`
- `email`
- `URL`
- `numbers`
- `dates`
- `date-times`
- `checkboxes`
- `radio buttons`
- `text areas`
- `select`

## Advanced input examples

Below are more examples that showcase how you can use advanced input types in your code. For full blink examples make sure you visit our [guides section](/blinks/blinks-provider/guides).

### Dropdown and radio buttons

```typescript
const payload: ActionGetResponse = {
  title: "Alice's Adventures",
  icon: "<image-url>",
  label: "Donate SOL",
  description: "Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Sign up for my newsletter!",
  links: {
    actions: [
      {
        label: "Sign Up", // button text
        href: "/api/donate?amount={amount}&choice={choice}",
        parameters: [
          {
            type: "select",
            name: "amount", // parameter name in the `href` above
            label: "Donation Amount in SOL", // placeholder of the text input
            required: true,
            options: [
              { label: "1", value: "1" },
              { label: "5", value: "5" },
              { label: "10", value: "10" },
            ],
          },
          {
            type: "radio",
            name: "choice", // parameter name in the `href` above
            label: "Do you want to sign up for our newsletter", // placeholder of the text input
            required: true,
            options: [
              { label: "Yes", value: "1" },
              { label: "No", value: "0" },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Here's what that would look like when unfurled:
