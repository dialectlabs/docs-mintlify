Blink scaffold Monad acts as a downloadable and reusable template that utilizes `NextJS` and `Tailwind` as the front end framework plus API routes for the backend. It comes with all necessary dependencies and configuration out of the box, so that you can immediately start building.

### Installation

#### Run our Scaffold command

To install the scaffold, all you have to do is run the command below in your terminal.

```bash
npx create-blinks-app
```

#### Set RPC URL 

By default, we use the Monad testnet RPC in our examples. If you have your own RPC, please update it in the `.env`-file. If you add your private RPC, don't forget to add the `.env` to your `.gitignore`.

```
# file: .env

# Fill in the URL of your Monad RPC (optional)

NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
```

### Run on localhost

Run the following command in your terminal

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. Please be reminded that the port 3000 could also be a different port. It is recommended to check the port in your terminal.
