## What Are Starters?

Starters are ready-to-use project templates that handle initial setup and configuration. They come with essential dependencies, tools, and examples so you can focus on building your blockchain experiences.

## Why Use Starters?

Every `Blink` consists of two core components: a `Blinks Provider` (backend) and a `Blinks Client` (frontend). Our starters make working with both seamless:

## Getting Started

To get you started, all you have to do is run the command below in your terminal. This will guide you through a small config process that helps you setup your project with our latest tools, install dependencies etc.

```bash
npx create-blinks-app
```

After you've executed the command, just `cd` into your new starter project folder and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
