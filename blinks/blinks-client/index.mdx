title: "Introduction"
description: "Blinks are distributable experiences that can be embedded anywhere a link can exist. They offer a modern approach to service integration, replacing traditional SDKs with a more streamlined, maintainable solution."

The Blinks Client provides [frontend components](/blinks/blinks-client/integrate/ui-components/blinks) and [headless integration](/blinks/blinks-client/integrate/headless/index) options for rendering and interacting with blinks in your applications.

### Key Benefits

- **Simple Integration**: Other developers can integrate your service in seconds while you maintain ownership of the blink
- **Consistent Experience**: Ensure your service implementation follows your design principles and best practices
- **Centralized Updates**: Changes made to your blink are automatically reflected everywhere it's served, eliminating SDK update cycles
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Blinks can unfurl to present an intuitive UI, encouraging user engagement through simple button clicks
