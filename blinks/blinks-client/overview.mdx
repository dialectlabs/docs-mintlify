# Blinks Client

Blinks are distributable experiences that can be embedded anywhere a link can exist. They offer a modern approach to service integration, replacing traditional SDKs with a more streamlined, maintainable solution.

The Blinks Client provides [frontend components](integrate/ui-components/blinks) and [headless integration](integrate/headless/index) options for rendering and interacting with blinks in your applications.

### Key Benefits

- **Simple Integration**: Other developers can integrate your service in seconds while you maintain ownership of the blink
- **Consistent Experience**: Ensure your service implementation follows your design principles and best practices
- **Centralized Updates**: Changes made to your blink are automatically reflected everywhere it's served, eliminating SDK update cycles
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Blinks can unfurl to present an intuitive UI, encouraging user engagement through simple button clicks

## Integration Methods

There are various possibilities to integrate blinks into your app. In any case, we strongly recommend to always use our SDKs, Dialect API and Terminal for the best possible experience.

### Headless Integration

For developers who need more flexibility, we offer HTTP endpoints to interact with blinks programmatically. This enables custom implementations and integrations with AI agents or other backend systems.

### UI Components

Our UI components provide ready-to-use React components that handle the rendering and interaction of blinks in your application. These components are designed to be easily integrated into your existing UI, handling all the complexity of blink rendering, unfurling, and user interactions while maintaining a consistent look and feel across different platforms.

## Testing

For testing blink unfurling, we recommend you to use either our [dial.to](https://dial.to) website or our [scaffolds](../blinks-scaffolds/index) which also have a blink client pre-configured.
