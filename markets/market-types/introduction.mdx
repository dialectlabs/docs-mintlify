Every protocol has its own developer tools, market types, wording and structure. Understanding each of these and building the right integrations is time comsuming and requires a lot of research. Our Marktes and Positions APIs are solving this issue by providing a unified format across all supported protocols. We fetch, parse and normalize this data, so that you can fetch it in a single http request. No specific protocol or web3 knowledge required.

**We support the following market types:**
