Every protocol has its own developer tools, market types, wording, and structure. Understanding each of these and building the right integrations is time-consuming and requires a lot of research.

Our Markets and Positions APIs solve this problem by providing a **unified forma**t across all [supported protocols](/markets/supported-protocols). We fetch, parse, and normalize this data so you can retrieve it in a single HTTP request. No specific protocol or web3 knowledge is required.

**We support the following market types:**
