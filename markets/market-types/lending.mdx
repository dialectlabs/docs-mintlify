Lending markets allow users to deposit assets and earn interest or borrow against them. Unlike [yield markets](/markets/market-types/yield) where returns come from DeFi strategies, lending markets generate returns through borrower interest payments and optional protocol rewards.

Our Markets API already contains lots of information that you would manually collect via multiple API calls throughout protocols and providers, such as:

- basic protocol information (one call contains multiple protocols),
- deposit and borrow APY information,
- token information,
- protocol rewards,
- LTV and liquidation parameters,
- actions (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay), etc.

By enriching the response with all of this information, it makes the API powerful enough to drive full-fledged dashboards and applications as well as smaller widgets, cards or notifications - All in a single API call!

## Supported Protocols

Our Markets API provides unified access to lending markets across multiple protocols:

- [**Kamino Borrow**](https://kamino.com/borrow)
- [**MarginFi**](https://marginfi.com/)
- [**Jupiter Lend**](https://jup.ag/lend/borrow)

If you want more information on the protocols that are supported, please refer to the [Supported Protocols Section](/markets/supported-protocols) page.

### Lending vs Yield

Lending markets differ from yield markets in how they generate returns and what functionality they offer. Below is a comparison of the two:

| Feature               | Lending Markets                                          | Yield Markets                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Action**    | Deposit to lend, with borrowing option                   | Deposit to earn                            |
| **Return Source**     | Borrower interest payments + protocol rewards (optional) | Earnings collected through DeFi strategies |
| **Collateralization** | Required for borrowing                                   | Not required                               |
| **Risk Profile**      | Credit risk + liquidation risk (if assets were borrowed) | Strategy-dependent                         |
| **Composability**     | Two-sided (lend + borrow)                                | Mostly single-sided                        |

## Data Structure

Below is an example of a lending market response from the Markets API. Based on customer demand, we may add more fields to the response in the future.

For the latest data structure, please have a look at our [Markets API Reference](/api-reference/markets/list-all-markets) page.

<Note>
  Please note that we do our best to design our APIs to be non-breaking. It is
  recommended to filter the response and only include the fields / types you
  need to ensure it won't break your application if new fields are added over
  time.

### Understanding the Response

What you can see here is the original response from the API. As mentioned in the introduction section, this response is powerful enough to drive full-fledged dashboards and applications.

Let's break it down into its components:

- **Market Identity:**

  - `id`: Unique identifier combining protocol and reserve address
  - `type`: Market category (always `lending` for lending markets)
  - `provider`: Protocol information for branding in your UI
  - `token`: Full token information including address, symbol, decimals and icon
  - `websiteUrl`: Direct link to the market on the protocol's website

- **Deposit APY Breakdown:**

  - `depositApy` (5.46%) — Total combined deposit yield including rewards
  - `baseDepositApy` (1.38%) — Core yield from borrower interest
  - `baseDepositApy30d` (1.16%) — Historical 30-day average
  - `baseDepositApy90d` (1.95%) — Historical 90-day average
  - `baseDepositApy180d` (2.65%) — Historical 180-day average
  - `rewards` array (4.09% USDS) — Additional incentive tokens for depositors

- **Borrow APY Breakdown:**

  - `borrowApy` (4.48%) — Total cost to borrow (can be reduced by rewards)
  - `baseBorrowApy` (4.48%) — Base borrowing cost
  - `baseBorrowApy30d` (4.57%) — Historical 30-day average
  - `baseBorrowApy90d` (5.17%) — Historical 90-day average
  - `baseBorrowApy180d` (5.96%) — Historical 180-day average

- **Market Metrics:**

  - `totalDeposit` / `totalDepositUsd`: This market holds $22.4M USDS in deposits
  - `totalBorrow` / `totalBorrowUsd`: $8.7M USDS currently borrowed
  - `maxDeposit`: Maximum deposit cap (150M)
  - `maxBorrow`: Maximum borrow cap (140M)

  **Note:** `totalDepositUsd` and `totalBorrowUsd` are USD values, the rest are native token units.

- **Risk Parameters:**

  - `maxLtv` (80%) — Maximum loan-to-value ratio for borrowing
  - `liquidationLtv` (90%) — LTV threshold that triggers liquidation
  - `liquidationPenalty` — Penalty applied during liquidation (when available)

- **Actions:** The `actions` object contains Blink URLs for `deposit`, `withdraw`, `borrow`, `repay`, and optionally `repayWithCollateral` and `claimRewards` depending on the protocol.

- **Additional Data:** The `additionalData` object contains protocol-specific metadata. In this example, we have the following additional data for the Kamino USDS Main Market:
  - `marketAddress`: The address of the lending market
  - `reserveAddress`: The address of the reserve
  - `marketName`: The name of the market

### Protocol-Specific Additional Data

The `additionalData` field varies by provider. In our example, we have the following additional data for Kamino Lend:

```json Kamino Borrow
{
  "additionalData": {
    "marketAddress": "7u3HeHxYDLhnCoErrtycNokbQYbWGzLs6JSDqGAv5PfF",
    "reserveAddress": "BHUi32TrEsfN2U821G4FprKrR4hTeK4LCWtA3BFetuqA",
    "marketName": "Main Market"
  }
}
```

MarginFi returns a `groupAddress` in the additional data:

```json MarginFi
{
  "additionalData": {
    "groupAddress": "4qp6Fx6tnZkY5Wropq9wUYgtFxXKwE6viZxFHg3rdAG8"
  }
}
```

Jupiter Lend markets may include a `borrowToken` field at the root level when the borrowed token differs from the collateral token:

```json Jupiter Borrow (with borrowToken)
{
  "token": {
    "address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
    "symbol": "WSOL",
    "decimals": 9,
    "icon": "https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/21629/large/solana.jpg?1696520989"
  },
  "borrowToken": {
    "address": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
    "symbol": "USDC",
    "decimals": 6,
    "icon": "https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/large/usdc.png?1696506694"
  }
}
```

As we continue to add more providers and markets, the `additionalData` field will continue to grow and be more powerful. If you need more information or want to check out what protocols are supported, please refer to the [Supported Protocols](/markets/supported-protocols) page.
