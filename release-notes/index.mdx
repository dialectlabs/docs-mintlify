## AI-Powered Development with MCP Integration

We've launched our **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integration, bringing conversational Web3 development to your favorite AI tools. Now you can build, fetch, integrate and share Blinks or Alerts directly through Cursor, and any  other AI development environments.

- One-command setup: `npx mint-mcp add dialect`
- Full access to Dialect's APIs through natural language
- Built-in documentation search with AI-powered contextual results
- Perfect for rapid Blinks development and API integration

Learn more in the [MCP docs](/mcp).

## Markets API (Beta) Launch

Introducing **Markets** - real-time market data from Solana's top lending protocols, unified in a single API. Get APYs, TVL, and liquidity data with ready-to-use Blinks for seamless DeFi interactions.

- Real-time lending rates across MarginFi and Kamino
- Comprehensive market data (deposits, borrows, limits, token metadata)
- Pre-built transactions for deposits and withdrawals
- No need to learn individual protocol SDKs

## Universal Inbox with Jupiter Partnership

The **Universal Inbox** breaks down notification silos across Web3 applications. Users can now receive notifications from multiple subscribed apps in one unified feed.

- Granular control over which apps to receive notifications from
- Unified message history with cross-channel delivery
